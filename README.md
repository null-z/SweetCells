SweetCells
============

SweetCells is a little syntactic sugar for those who use custom UITableViewCell in xib in their projects. SweetCells will not allow you to make a mistake with the identifier of the cell and nibName, and dequeueReusableCell will immediately return to you the cell of the desired class.
